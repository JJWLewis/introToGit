# Diff (the world before Git)

To use diff on the command line, just type
    diff -u file1 file2

## Generating diff files

When you need to send suggested changes to someone, it's easiest to send a diff. Once you've made the changes in a second file, create the diff by using:

    diff -u old_file new_file > change.diff

These are sometimes called patch files.

## Applying diff/patch files

To automatically apply a patch file

    patch old_file < patch_file
